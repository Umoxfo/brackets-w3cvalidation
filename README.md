# brackets-w3cvalidation (by Umoxfo)
A Brackets extension to enable W3C validation support. To use this extension, open any HTML file and then check the bottom right corner of Brackets (where all files are checked) and look for either the green icon (all is well) or the yellow warning sign (issues).
